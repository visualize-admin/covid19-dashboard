The test results are recorded via our reporting system as well as via a national SARS-⁠CoV-⁠2 monitoring programme. They may differ from the numbers communicated by the cantons and Liechtenstein.\n\nThe novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the infectious disease COVID-19 is constantly changing due to mutations in its genome (changes in the genetic code). Virus variants are designated and classified on the basis of these mutations. Most mutations have little or no impact on the properties of the virus. However, some SARS-CoV-2 variants are characterised by altered pathogen properties which can influence the epidemiological situation, for example because they are more contagious, cause more serious illness or evade a person’s immune response even though they have had an infection or have been vaccinated (immune evasion). For most known variants there is still a high level of protection against severe courses of the disease for people who are fully vaccinated. For some variants there are still no conclusive findings. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants\" target=\"_blank\">WHO</a> has classified individual virus variants as VOCs (Variants of Concern) and VOIs (Variants of Interest). These virus variants are being specifically monitored. In Switzerland and Liechtenstein, the classification of variants may differ from that of the WHO.

The test results are recorded via our reporting system as well as via a national SARS-⁠⁠CoV-⁠⁠2 monitoring programme. They may differ from the numbers communicated by the cantons and Liechtenstein.\n\nThe novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the infectious disease COVID-19 is constantly changing due to mutations in its genome (changes in the genetic code). Virus variants are designated and classified on the basis of these mutations. Most mutations have little or no impact on the properties of the virus. However, some SARS-CoV-2 variants are characterised by altered pathogen properties which can influence the epidemiological situation, for example because they are more contagious, cause more serious illness or evade a person’s immune response even though they have had an infection or have been vaccinated (immune evasion). For most known variants there is still a high level of protection against severe courses of the disease for people who are fully vaccinated. For some variants there are still no conclusive findings. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants\" target=\"_blank\">WHO</a> has classified individual virus variants as VOCs (Variants of Concern) and VOIs (Variants of Interest). These virus variants are being specifically monitored. In Switzerland and Liechtenstein, the classification of variants may differ from that of the WHO.

The WHO classification, Switzerland and Principality of Liechtenstein consider this variant to be a variant of concern (VOC). There are still no validated findings with regard to this variant’s pathogen properties. Given its mutations, greater communicability and reduced immune protection are suspected. This means that there could be the risk of renewed infection and the possibility of reduced vaccine protection. These could likewise lead to greater communicability. This variant was first detected in Botswana and South Africa in November 2021.",

The WHO classifies this variant as a variant of concern (VOC) because it can cause a more serious case of illness and has immune-⁠evasive properties. This means that there could be the risk of renewed infection and the possibility of reduced vaccine protection.  This variant was first detected in South Africa in May 2020. Since it currently has no influence on the epidemiological situation in Switzerland and the Principality of Liechtenstein, since the beginning of August 2021 it has no longer been designated a variant of concern in these territories.",

According to the WHO classification, this virus variant family is deemed a variant of concern (VOC) because it is more transmissible, causes severe disease and has immune escape properties. This means there is a risk of reinfection and possible reduced vaccine efficacy. This variant was first detected in India in October 2020. Since late June 2021, this has been the dominant variant in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. It has therefore not been classified as a variant of concern in these regions since mid-⁠August 2021.",

According to the WHO classification and in Switzerland, Lambda is deemed a variant of interest (VOI) because it is presumed to have immune escape properties. This means there is a risk of reinfection and possible reduced vaccine efficacy. This variant was first detected in Peru in December 2020.  It does not currently have an impact on the epidemiological situation in Switzerland and Liechtenstein and is therefore not classified as a variant of concern.",
  "IndicatorsDescription.OverviewCardVirusVariant.VariantP1": "This indicator shows the latest available value for the rolling 7-day average (average of previous 3 to subsequent 3 days) of the estimated proportion of variant P.1 - Gamma. The WHO classifies this variant as a variant of concern (VOC) because it can cause a more serious case of illness and has immune-⁠evasive properties. This means that there could be the risk of renewed infection and the possibility of reduced vaccine protection.This variant was first detected in Brazil and Japan at the end of 2020.

However, some SARS-CoV-2 variants are characterised by altered pathogen properties which can influence the epidemiological situation, for example because they are more contagious, cause more serious illness or evade a person’s immune response even though they have had an infection or have been vaccinated (immune evasion).

For some variants there are still no conclusive findings. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants\" target=\"_blank\">WHO</a> has classified individual virus variants as VOCs (Variants of Concern) and VOIs (Variants of Interest).

Cases despite full vaccination are to be expected; this is because while the efficacy of the vaccine is very high, it is still below 100%.\n\nWe have been collecting data on immunisation status since the end of January 2021. These data are based on information sent to us by doctors and hospitals under their duty to notify.\n\nWe assume that the number of unrecorded cases among those fully vaccinated is higher than for those not vaccinated. This is due to the fact that vaccinated people often experience only mild symptoms and are therefore less likely to visit a doctor; or they get themselves tested at test centres or pharmacies because they do not need medical treatment. In the latter case, we receive a report on the laboratory findings, but no indication as to the person’s vaccination status.\n\nIf you are assessing cases despite full vaccination, please consider the proportion of fully vaccinated people (under the vaccination strategy older people are more likely to be vaccinated) and all cases in the same time period.",

For Johnson & Johnson (Covid-19 Vaccine Janssen®), a single dose of vaccine is required to be deemed fully vaccinated. Those who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, but who have not yet had a booster vaccination are still deemed to be fully vaccinated. The efficacy of the vaccines available in Switzerland is very high. They provide effective protection against symptomatic infection, in particular severe forms of the disease, and they reduce the risk of transmission. However, this does not mean that those who are fully vaccinated (with or without a booster vaccination) cannot become infected, as no vaccine provides 100% protection.\n\nWe have been collecting data on vaccination status since the end of January 2021. It is based on information that doctors and hospitals deliver to us as part of the reporting requirement. For hospitalisations and deaths in connection with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, they also transmit the vaccination status in addition to the clinical information. \n\nThe information on incidence is per 100,000 inhabitants with the corresponding vaccination status of («fully vaccinated», «fully vaccinated with booster vaccination», «partially vaccinated» and «not vaccinated»).
